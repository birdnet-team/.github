BirdNET uses deep learning to identify **6,000+ bird species** worldwide from sound. We build open-source tools that scale from a single recording to continent-wide monitoring programs — making professional bioacoustics accessible to researchers, conservationists, and citizen scientists alike.

> A joint initiative of the [K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/) at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/informatik/Medieninformatik/index.php.en).
